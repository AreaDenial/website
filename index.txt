@Accelerating 3D Rendering:This series of lessons marks the beginning of the advanced section in which we will explore various modern ray-tracing frameworks and/or solutions. Best read in chronological order. This section is currently being written (Q3/Q4 2022) and will consequently be regularly changing.
